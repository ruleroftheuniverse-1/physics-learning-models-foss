# Physics Learning Models (FOSS)
Greetings!

This is a growing open-source collection of small code projects to help people **learn physics by building**.

We believe that science should be **accessible to everyone**, not just those with access to expensive tools, elite universities, or proprietary software.  
By making simple, hands-on models, we hope to deepen our own understanding — and help others along the way.

All are welcome to learn, contribute, and remix!

## Goals
- Create small, understandable code models for major physics concepts and processes.
- Build intuition through code and visualization.
- Keep everything lightweight and beginner-friendly.
- Support each other as learners, not just show off "perfect" solutions. :)
- Share freely under an open license.

## Topics We Plan to Cover
- **Mechanics** (motion, forces, energy)
- **Thermodynamics** (heat, entropy)
- **Electromagnetism** (fields, circuits)
- **Quantum Mechanics** (basic wavefunctions, operators)
- **Optics** (lenses, diffraction)
- **Statistical Physics**
- **Relativity** (special & general)
- **Math Tools** (linear algebra, vector calculus)

## How to Get Involved
- Try out the code examples and tweak them.
- Add your own small models!
- Open issues if you're stuck or curious.
- Help us improve documentation or visuals.

## License
This project is licensed under the GPL 3.0 License — meaning you can use, modify, and share it freely, as long as you allow others the same access to your code.
